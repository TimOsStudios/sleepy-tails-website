      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    </header>
    
    <p><strong>Last updated: April 10, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand how your data is handled.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <p>Our philosophy is simple: we want to make our product better without knowing who you are. We have intentionally designed our App to collect only anonymous information that helps us improve functionality.</p>
    
    <p><strong>We DO NOT collect:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identifiers (name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Demographic information (age, gender)</li>
      <li>Contact information (unless you email us for help)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>We DO collect:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> How the App is used (screens viewed, features accessed, actions taken) to understand what's working and what needs improvement</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic technical details about your device to ensure compatibility and performance</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> App speed, crashes, and technical issues to help us fix problems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>All collected data serves one purpose: making our App better for everyone. We have no interest in who you are personally - we only care about creating the best possible user experience.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    
    <p>We use the information we collect solely for product improvement purposes:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>To analyze how users interact with our App</li>
      <li>To identify and fix technical issues</li>
      <li>To improve App performance and functionality</li>
      <li>To develop new features based on user behavior</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We do not use your data for targeted advertising or sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
    
    <p>We use a limited number of third-party services to help us analyze App performance and user engagement:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use analytics tools to understand how users interact with our App.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP):</strong> We use an MMP to track App installation and performance data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These service providers are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    
    <p>We retain your data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:</p>
    
    <p><strong>EU/EEA Residents (GDPR):</strong> You have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict processing, and port your personal data. You also have the right to object to our processing of your data and to withdraw consent.</p>
    
    <p><strong>California Residents (CCPA):</strong> You have the right to know what personal information we collect, disclose, or sell; to delete your personal information; to opt-out of the sale of personal information; and to non-discrimination for exercising these rights.</p>
    
    <p>To exercise your rights, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
